# Session 1

- Open discussion @starfishnetwork on bitcoin/ethereum whitepaper on **06/09/18**.
- Notes from **samsuh**.

## Finality

- Anonymity.
- Decentralization + Resistance to censorship.

## Usage  

- Priority: Speed, ease of usage.
- Sure, anonymous etc is cool. But in a system where the population’s growing, and transaction speed is most important and micropayments.
- Speed/ Micropayments/ Ease of usage.
- Permissionless-ness of decentralization.
- Doesn’t matter if you have the best blockchain in the world if people can’t use it.
- Commerce is power.

## Game theory

- Forcible. Violence power (state has a monopoly) - private military. You can't fight the state. Biggest fish.
- Money power: corporations, lobbying.  - substantial.
- People power: community organizing - adoption - if people can effectively organize, there’s power. (pseudo-anonymity)/ boycotts.
- 3+4 is consensus.

## Governance

- The job of the government is to govern.
- As a community, people can agree upon a set of principles, and adhere to those.
- Some people have nothing. How do we bring them into the system.
- Money just allows you to manage your resources and to manage your freedom.
- Tokenizing freedom?
- Too much freedom is a dangerous thing.

## Solutions

- Shifting our thinking to how we provide solutions. Get rid of the questions.
- This is the reality of the new world, whether you want it or not. It’s like a new law of physics.

## News Accuracy

- Attention span/bandwidth.
- Real world to digital.
- In-Formation power. Media. Weaponized “fake news” scares. Governments (centralized bodies) being empowered to filter for us.
