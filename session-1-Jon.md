## Protocol

Coda Protocol, reach people. Takes huge amount of data, compresses it smaller.  Verifying transactions on a phone, truly decentralized.  Compression/ as old as bitcoin, if you can compress small data sets, blockchain in small pieces, verify. Technology like this, eventually catch on.

## Sam's opinion

Sam, think it's interesting, startup competitor to file coin, taking file sizes, doing something similar to bittorrent, opposite of compression, makes it bigger, and resilient to deletion, using 25% data.

## General discussion

This is something wanted to do for years, all started w a white paper, started.  Everyone says over and over, but how many people know it, how many read through it, how many understand whatâ€™s in it?.

## Bicoin

Kick it off, bitcoin, found a way to trustlessly peer to peer money, way to make it unique, before this,everything digital was copyable, this is a way to make your mp3 different than mine, and keep track of it?.

Is there waste in it?  That goes back to file storage. Put it on file storage, go to one place and go get it.  What if you get blocked from accessing that? What if that goes down?  Put your single file on 4, 20, or 100 servers, why would they give out all that data, pain to manage and it goes down.

## Possible flaws

There seems to be a variety of inherent flaws, 1 the ledger is public, basic graph theory, together map of transactions, who is related to whom, even with burner phone, ways to do it, does anyone else see any flaws with public ledger that isn't anonymous, use blockchain to control people, force people to use transactions, they can look it.

Was fascinated w how much the US government likes bitcoin, its been, will sell 250,000 btc to tim draper, embrace the tech integrate to our legislation,

## Discussion

Picked up from reading the white paper, contentious bitcoin cash vs bitcoin, chunk on privacy in the bitcoin whitepaper, track public, keys, not anonymous, fiat on ramps, liked ss #s, the 1% written into the white paper, requirement they are anonymous, coinbase, pic, ss, id, fb, up in two hours.

Intro to computer security, security through obscurity is not security, if hiding under the mattress not secure, don't know who the address is, it provides a pattern for governments to use cryptocurrencies, big concern when people are talking about UBI, improve for people in the middle of a criss, how can we support them?  Give them $ on the blockchain see how they spend the $, grey line, trust to be a human.

Follow up points, treasury and fintel, no problem w a public blockchain, people are openly saying in a senate hearing, lot of potential negative downside, if implemented without privacy, need to have a conversation

## Petro

Petro

IF we don't have the infrastructure to buy it is it really a cryptocurrency

Its a NEM protocol, can be bought

Europe, stark difference between sweden and germany, everything is cc and debit cards, cause they trust their gov, in germany they have a strong support for cash, even the german central bank is a strong supporter of a cash economy, truly anonymous

Petro example of restricting what we can do, let anyone do anything just let them understand the consequences, not you may not do this, you can do whatever you want, but this is the true consequence.  

Nice in theory, not in practical life.  

Have to be consequences?

Consequences should be well defined, implemented in a trustless system, those ways out should be well known, if i do these 20 things in the exact way, system will self optimize.

One step forward beyond that, in the pentagon example you were talking about, works somewhere under certain rules, they can't do that anywhere, can't do that anywhere, it's not the world agreeing, its not everyone individually agreeing, the system itself.  

## Blockchain Properties

One fundamental thing on blockchain you can't do, you can't reverse a transaction.  

When i look at ethereum, have some questions, used to developing, free to do that on your computer, people used to accessing tech for free, able to make mistakes, reach out to customer support and getting things reversed, making thing on ethereum blockchain and lost 300 million dollars, paying every single time i put on a new version, figured out how to do versioning, the solution is, this address here will point out my program, 12 versions based on my own progress,, 3 issues
1 how well does that immutability work w humans
2 paying for tech?
3 how long can we sustain the storage space? Not everyone can hold that much storage?  300 years down the line even 5 years from now

Which part to address- immutability, approach these systems, see them as human systems, proof of work blockchain, tree falls down no putting the trees backup, proof of stake is a human system not a natural system.

## Storage

Storage thing, a lot of things, connect networks together, did a defining blockchain network, come up with a network of blockchains is a blockchain.  Systems mirroring biological reality, revisiting core assumptions such as anonymity, can we have it in physical reality?  Is it realistic in 3d mean space?  In a world where all humans have perfect intention and integrity, what's the utility? Anonymity is built to handle flaus in culture.

Anonymity, is flawed, resistant to censorship. Ethereum isn't offering anything new in anonymity, nor bitcoin, decentralization portion resistant to censorship.

3d mean space, important fact there is people forget, not be anonymous in village or neighborhood, people forget our memories change, store so much data nowadays, not just about our neighbors, this data can be used, transactions can be encrypted, metadata, some amount of what happened in the past, this person, this organization.

Inherent conflict of blockchain with the universal principle of entropy, disintegration. Forgetting is a form of entropy.

Can the landscape change significantly, if capturing more data, is it harder to do data analysis, instead of a few billions, a few quadrillions?  Algorithm running off that principle, easier to do what you want whatever you ask for.  A Lot of thought or energy, mention 2 things we haven't addressed yet, ever increasing storage, outdo, can store 100 gigabytes of stuff, regarding versioning, decentralized apps work rightnow, have your UI pointing at a different thing, area of security you have to think of repoint your UI, repoint asking for trouble, other project we are working on, censorship resistant, fully decentralized, natural system instead of a human buildt system,

Data storage problem, increasing on orders of magnitude.  System is optimized as 16million, sharding data and algorithmically distorted that, algorithm that takes it from the wind, downside its computationally intensive, trading off storage vs computation, storage becomes a big problem, not a lot.  

Including off chain?  Define off chain.

Solution is not a blockchain solution.  Data sharding not transaction sharding.

## Discussion-2

Guns germs and steel, one of his books about human civilizations in traditional societies, 100,000 of years without a form of government, think about reputation in a small tribe, reputation of ranking and reviews, not anonymous anymore, can't rebuild your life if reputation is tarnished, see how humans and human civilizations, lived in a different world, deal w all these tools made available,store so much data on everybody.

## Features

Look at anonymity, publish data, population is 1.3 continues to grow, shining, from people all time, most efficient use case, speed is usage.  DOn't have this doesn't mean anything, be anonymous, system where population is growing, transaction speed, buy vegetables, reding the 

Hiding a shit ton of cash, want to transfer money to bitcoin and ethereum, exchange in india, getting transported, be anonymized, transferring data, systems pay taxes.  

Feel like its compelling to go down rabbit holes, features facets and liabilities of these systems. What's our high level objective, mechanism to reframe commerce and industry on earth? Why? Curren thing is broken?

Microtransactions and speed?  

## Capital Controls

China and capital controls i don't want to live here, cant leave, what do i do? Individual adaptations of this tech, interoperable, people then come to the table w their own problems, discuss problems.

Different, matts point redefine the blockchain, optimized for speed, make an all in one solution, make systems more efficient, flaws of..

Does it require revolution?
It requires adoption?
Government can we control it?
Corporations, can we coopt this?

## Discussion-3

State
1 VIolence
2 Money - corporate buyers, lobbying groups
3 people power- community organizing.  Boycotts.  
4 Information

Use of force, different than violence.
